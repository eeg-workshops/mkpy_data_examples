The EEG data files in this repository were recorded for instructional
purposes and are not human subjects research data.

The sample data files in `data` are generated by the jupyter notebooks
in docs. The files are updated automatically when the documentation is
generated and `nbsphinx` runs the jupyter notebooks.

We gratefully acknowledge the support of grant NICHD 5R01HD022614 for the development of these routines.
